czj info:

cgp-lil-gp 1.1.1/1.02 does

  read constraints to limit search space
  allow different weights for the remaining elements of mutation sets
    which affect probabilities of mutating/selecting a given function/terminal
  changes lil-gp 1.02 in a few ways
    a) resets index members fo fset functions
    b) allows to use depth ramp for both initialization and mutation
       to specify the absolute minimal depths (in lil-gp smaller
       depths were still possible in the grow mode)
    c) crossover is reimplemented so that source trees are selected based 
       on mutation set weights and the internal/external parameter

Change from cgp1.1:
       initialization and mutation/uniform mutation modified to 
       never generate trees (if possible due to constraints) shorher than the
       min depth ramp (NOTE: only if the corresponding parameter depth_abs
       is set to true
